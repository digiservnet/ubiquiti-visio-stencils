# Ubiquiti Visio Stencils

This repo contains a collection of networking products from (Ubiquity)[https://ubnt.com] for use with Microsoft Visio.

Each component has connection points already defined generally as each component is set up, for example; a 16-port switch will have 16 connection points for each of the RJ45 ports, plus any additional connection points for SPF/+ ports.

Access points (UAP-AC-PRO for example) I've added 4 pairs of 2 connection points as although the APs only have 2 RJ45 ports for main and throughput, not every diagram would easily be able to utilise the connection points in the same position.

I welcome any comments, suggestions or issues :)
